### **Introduction**

This repository focuses on the classification of driving styles through the analysis of vehicle sensor data using machine learning techniques.

### **Jupyter Notebook Overview**

- **Project Notebook:** A comprehensive Jupyter Notebook that encompasses the entire project workflow â€” from data loading to data analysis to the training, validation, and evaluation of machine learning models (SVM, Logistic Regression and kNN). 

### **Installation Setup Guide**

The following is a step by step guide on how you can clone this repository down on to your own machine and get it running. Please ensure you have the following prerequisites installed before continuing.

### **Prerequisites**

Ensure the following tools and libraries are installed before proceeding:

Installation of `git` <br>
Installation of `Python 3` (versions 3+)
or
Installation of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)<br>
Installation of `Visual Studio Code`, with extension `Jupyter` & `notebook`

### **Step 1: Clone Repository:**

In order to clone the github repository, use the following command:<br>
git clone https://github.com/The-Mad-Ryanosaurus/ML-Models.git<br>
This link can be found in the green code button at the top of this page under the HTTPS tab.

### **Step 2: Install Project Dependencies:**

In the same terminal window you used to clone the repository, do the following step by step:
`pip install pandas`<br>
`pip install numpy`<br>
`pip install matplotlib`<br>
`pip install seaborn`<br>
`pip install scikit-learn`

Remember to restart the Jupyter kernel if you encounter any import errors after installation.

Should the installs fail, run your command prompt as an administrator and try again from [Step 1](#step1). If you do not have administration permissions on your machine, try adding '--user' after each 'pip install'. Ex: pip install --user "_dependency_"

### **Step 3: Open Project in Visual Studio Code:**

Still in the same terminal window do the following:<br>
code .<br>
This will open VS code and you can now access and run the project jupyter notebook.
